This project was made as a code-along with MayanWolfe's video tutorial as a form of practice and learning. 
What I learned: 
1) Using Heroku for the first time to host the app we built
2) Getting more practice with server-side code
3) Getting more practice with making a request to the server, handling that request, sending the data back, and parsing it back to the DOM
4) Getting more practice with the try catch statements
